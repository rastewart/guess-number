My implementation of a number guessing game from [Head First Go](http://headfirstgo.com/)

## Sample output

Let's play a guessing game!
-----------------------------------------------------------
Guess a number between 1 and 100
Please enter your guess (1 of 5): 50
Your guess is too LOW! 
Please enter your guess (2 of 5): 70
Your guess is too LOW! 
Please enter your guess (3 of 5): 90

Please enter your guess (4 of 5): 80
